# 13E-Commerce-Back-End

## User Story

As a manager at an internet retail company... I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Given a functional Express.js API...when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
* When I enter schema and seed commands then  a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
* When I enter the command to invoke the application then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
* When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
* When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
